    <div class="content">
      <p>I was born and raised near the coast in Barry, South Wales (Yes the Gavin and Stacey place), before heading up
        to Scotland for university.</p>

      <p>As a kid I was always drawing or playing guitar. I even tried writing songs at one point (they weren't great).
        Then I got into magic (both The Gathering and tricks) and cardistry, but gaming was the thing that really stuck.
        It's what eventually pushed me to learn coding, just so I could try to recreate the games I loved.</p>

      <p>I went to the University of St Andrews to study Computer Science. Things went well for a while — I made the
        Dean's List and even picked up an award for my work in CS2006 Advanced Programming Projects — but my mental
        health hit rock bottom. After 3 years I had a breakdown, resulting in a suicide attempt, and a stint in a
        psychiatric ward, and I ultimately decided to step away. It was tough, but it gave me the space I needed to
        start putting myself back together.</p>

      <p>While I was still at uni, I got my first taste of professional work as a Web Developer Intern, building things
        with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Around the same time, I started freelancing. I established connections through a
        Community Interest Company I co-founded and now help run, which supports people struggling with mental health.
        Most of that work was building temporary mini-sites, tweaking and expanding on existing frameworks. Over time, I
        picked up React, TailwindCSS, Next.js and TypeScript, and got hooked on frontend development.</p>

      <p>These days I'm back home in South Wales, juggling freelance work and running the CIC while leveling up my dev
        and software engineering skills. I'm also on the lookout for a normal part-time job while I figure out where I
        want to go next.</p>

      <p>Get in touch with me if you think we could work together: <a
